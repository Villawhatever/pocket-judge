Draven triggers if he’s among the units that survive.\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether combat damage was actually dealt, only that there was a combat showdown and only your units were left after combat damage.

After all, the token’s not missing; it just doesn’t have a cost because it doesn’t need one. We’ll be updating the rules to clarify that the cost of a token can be treated as 0 for all purposes."

This is an ambiguity in the current rules, which refer to “appending” and “removing” rules text without reference to whether that text is original to the unit or not.\n\nThe key word here is actually copy, a system that will be fleshed out in a future rules update. For now, we’ll just tell you that copies of objects or text take on their original traits, without regard to any subsequent alterations.\n\nSvellsongur doesn’t grant the unit additional “copies” of the abilities of other Equipment.

For example: If a Recruit was at Trifarian War Camp, it would have 2 Might (its 1 base Might, +1 from War Camp). If it got hit with Stupefy, Stupefy would “snapshot” at -1 Might, reducing the Recruit’s Might to 1. If the Recruit then moved away from Trifarian War Camp, it would lose the +1 Might bonus and end up at 0 Might. It’s much easier to make it happen with Spiritforged cards, though, so it’s worth reviewing the rules for units with 0 or less Might."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does a unit with 0 or less Might automatically die?",
        "answer": "No, units can stick around on the board with 0 (or less!) Might. They will die if they take any damage, but “0” is not a valid amount of damage, so it takes 1 damage to kill a unit with 0 or less Might. We realize that this is a little weird, but it’s important to us that cards like Frigid Touch can’t be used to actually kill units, only weaken them."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does a unit with negative Might contribute negative damage to my Might total in combat?",
        "answer": "No. Negative Might is treated as 0 Might for the purposes of dealing damage, but as its true value for raising it back above 0. So a unit with -3 Might would contribute 0 damage in combat, would die if it was dealt 1 or more damage, and would require +4 Might to get it back up to 1 Might."

        "question": "What costs does Ezreal, Prodigy reduce? Does he reduce Repeat costs? Accelerate costs? Equip costs?",
        "answer": "Ezreal, Prodigy reduces additional costs that are optional to pay. These will generally use both the words “additional cost” and the word “may.” Repeat and Accelerate are the two main sources of optional additional costs, but Ezreal can also offer a discount for one-off oddballs like Blast Corps Cadet.\n\nEzreal can’t reduce Equip costs. That’s an activation cost for an ability, so it’s neither optional nor additional. There aren’t currently any optional additional costs that apply to activating abilities."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about Deflect costs? Aren’t those optional now?",
        "answer": "No, Ezreal won’t help with Deflect costs, and Deflect is not optional. Deflect is a mandatory additional cost, meaning you must pay it if you want to finalize a spell or ability that chooses something with Deflect. It’s true that you can choose not to pay Deflect costs for triggered abilities by choosing not to finalize them, but that doesn’t make it an optional cost."

      {
        "question": "If I use Hostile Takeover to take control of my opponent’s only unit at a battlefield, will there be a showdown? Will it be a combat?",
        "answer": "You’ll start a noncombat showdown. (Hostile Takeover’s reminder text is a little misleading in this regard—you have to have some kind of showdown before you can conquer.) This ruling applies any time you have a unit at a battlefield when your opponent still controls that battlefield, but doesn’t have any units there. (Yes, that can happen. Hostile Takeover and Stormbringer are the easiest ways to do it.)\n\nThere’s a gap in the current rules that leaves this situation without an obvious outcome. We plan to address that gap in the next regular rules update. The issue is surprisingly complex, and we’re not 100% sure what the answer will be when we’re done.\n\nIn the meantime, though, we believe starting a noncombat showdown is the least disruptive way to handle this scenario. If you need really precise timing: assume that your opponent loses control of the battlefield in the same cleanup that begins the showdown, even though ordinarily control is “frozen” once the battlefield becomes contested."

      {
        "question": "What parts of a spell does the Repeat ability cause to be repeated? Is it the entire effect? If I use Temporal Portal to give Find Your Center Repeat and pay the cost while its cost reduction applies, does the cost reduction happen once or twice, and does the final spell cost 2 or 4?",
        "answer": "Repeat causes you to repeat execution of a spell’s “instructions,” which are the things the spell tells you to do as it resolves. (We’ll give a better definition of “instructions” and how to define them in an upcoming rules update.) And the Repeat cost of Find Your Center isn’t reduced, even when its base cost is, because anything that asks for a card’s cost finds its printed cost as the answer.\n\nThis means that Find Your Center’s cost reduction applies only once and the final spell costs 4—its base cost of 3, plus its Repeat cost of 3, minus its cost reduction of 2."

        "answer": "Oh, sharp catch. Weaponmaster as a keyword is always meant to be optional. While the rules utilize a language structure that imply a mandatory target, the reminder text is more accurate here. It is always a choice on whether or not to use this play ability. We will clean up that language in the future. "
